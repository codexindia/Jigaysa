"""Event → notification + gamification wiring (PRD §3.12).

Connected in ``NotificationsConfig.ready()``. Kept as post_save receivers so
producers (enrollment, grading, certificates…) don't need to know notifications
exist. Handlers are defensive: a notification failure must never break the
underlying action, so callers wrap nothing and we swallow lookups gracefully.
